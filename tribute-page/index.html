    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Elvis life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1935, January 8<sup>th</sup></strong> - Born in Tupelo, 
        Mississippi
      </li>
       <li>
         <strong>1953</strong> - graduated from L. C. Humes High School 
         in Memphis, he began working as a truck driver to pay his way 
          into the Memphis Recording Services studio to cut his own 
          records. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1954, July 19<sup>th</sup></strong> - recorded 
        "That's All Right Mama" for Sun Records. It became his first 
        commercial release, selling twenty thousand copies. Later, 
        in 2004, this release will be announsed as the beginning of 
        the Roc&Roll era.  

              </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1955</strong> - reached the top of the country charts 
        with "Mystery Train". His first number one song on the so-called 
        "Hot 100" was "Heartbreak Hotel" (1956), which held that position 
        for seven of the twenty-seven weeks it was on the chart. This song 
        also reached the top of the country charts, and it became a symbol 
        of his ability to combine country singing with rhythm-and-blues, 
        as well as with the new rage that had grown out of rhythm-and-blues: 
        rock 'n' roll.  
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1958</strong> - began a well-publicized stint in the 
        army. That year, while he was stationed in Fort Hood, Texas, his 
        mother died. The remainder of his military service was spent 
        stationed in Germany, until his discharge (release) in 1960.

        
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1967</strong> - married Priscilla Beaulieu and she bore 
        him his only child, Lisa Marie Presley, in 1968.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1973</strong> - was divorsed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>late 1960s </strong> - became increasingly dependent on
         drugs, particularly amphetamines and sedatives. His personal doctor,
          George Nichopoulos, would later be prosecuted, but acquitted, 
          for prescribing and dispensing thousands of pills and narcotics 
          (illegal drugs) to him.

        

      
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1977, August 16<sup>th</sup></strong> - was found dead 
        in Graceland Mansion by his fianc√©e, Ginger Alden. The official 
        cause of death was heart disease, although information revealed 
        after his death about his drug dependency created a media event. 
        His death caused worldwide scenes of mourning.
